      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is divided in 3 sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction - since you took your precious time to be here. I want you to be comfortable ü§ó.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasks ‚úÖ&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi üëãüèª, I&amp;rsquo;m Yash. I&amp;rsquo;m from the EAC&#39;25 Batch. I have just started to familiarize myself with the vast majority of advanced coding and I&amp;rsquo;m very eager to contribute for the welfare of society. I seek guidance in learning new languages and strengthening them. I am looking forward to participate in GSoC. Also I am intrigued by the recent boom in Deep Learning and would like to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite excited upon seeing the tasks. The tasks have been designed for the people at all coding levels. From total newbies to coding maestros,there&amp;rsquo;s something for everyone. amFOSS taskmakers have done quite a good job at designing these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;experience&#34;&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section comprises the hardships I had to face. First of all even though I said there&amp;rsquo;s something for everyone, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing for slackers. So get that to your head, you&amp;rsquo;re going nowhere if you just laze out. I&amp;rsquo;m stating this from my personal experience.
Upon seeing task-05, I thought of it as something I could complete later but after a lot of time had already passed I found it difficult to complete. After completing it, I was mentally exhausted and wasn&amp;rsquo;t to focus on any other work for the day. So hey future tryouts if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this which I know some would, treat each and every &lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt; task equally. The most fun task to do was &lt;strong&gt;Task-02&lt;/strong&gt; as putting the co-ordinates in Google Maps was very lively. The most frustraing among all was the &lt;strong&gt;Golang Scrapper (Task-07)&lt;/strong&gt; used realising to use &lt;strong&gt;geziyor&lt;/strong&gt; after using &lt;strong&gt;colly&lt;/strong&gt; for straight 4 days was really exhausting. Now a note for future amFOSS aspirants - if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this do organise your repo from the first day itslef (it really helps on the deadline day)&lt;/p&gt;
