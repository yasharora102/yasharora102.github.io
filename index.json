I want you to be comfortable ü§ó. Tasks ‚úÖ Experience üìö    The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.  -- Introduction Hi üëãüèª, I\u0026rsquo;m Yash. I\u0026rsquo;m from the EAC'25 Batch. I have just started to familiarize myself with the vast majority of advanced coding and I\u0026rsquo;m very eager to contribute for the welfare of society. I seek guidance in learning new languages and strengthening them. I am looking forward to participate in GSoC. Also I am intrigued by the recent boom in Deep Learning and would like to learn more about it.\nTasks I was quite excited upon seeing the tasks. The tasks have been designed for the people at all coding levels. From total newbies to coding maestros,there\u0026rsquo;s something for everyone. amFOSS taskmakers have done quite a good job at designing these tasks.\nExperience This section comprises the hardships I had to face. First of all even though I said there\u0026rsquo;s something for everyone, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing for slackers. So get that to your head, you\u0026rsquo;re going nowhere if you just laze out. I\u0026rsquo;m stating this from my personal experience. Upon seeing task-05, I thought of it as something I could complete later but after a lot of time had already passed I found it difficult to complete. After completing it, I was mentally exhausted and wasn\u0026rsquo;t to focus on any other work for the day. So hey future tryouts if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this which I know some would, treat each and every main task equally. The most fun task to do was Task-02 as putting the co-ordinates in Google Maps was very lively. The most frustraing among all was the Golang Scrapper (Task-07) used realising to use geziyor after using colly for straight 4 days was really exhausting. Now a note for future amFOSS aspirants - if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this do organise your repo from the first day itslef (it really helps on the deadline day)\n","date":1637366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605830400,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2021-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"My first blog post regarding the amFOSS Tasks","tags":["Academic"],"title":"My Experience with amFOSS Tasks","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yash Arora"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
