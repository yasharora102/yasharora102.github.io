## Introduction

Hi üëãüèª, I'm Yash. I'm from the EAC'25 Batch. I have just started to familiarize myself with the vast majority of advanced coding and I'm very eager to contribute for the welfare of society. I seek guidance in learning new languages and strengthening them. I am looking forward to participate in GSoC. Also I am intrigued by the recent boom in Deep Learning and would like to learn more about it.
## Tasks

I was quite excited upon seeing the tasks. The tasks have been designed for the people at all coding levels. From total newbies to coding maestros,there's something for everyone. amFOSS taskmakers have done quite a good job at designing these tasks.

## Experience
This section comprises the hardships I had to face. First of all even though I said there's something for everyone, there's nothing for slackers. So get that to your head, you're going nowhere if you just laze out. I'm stating this from my personal experience. 
Upon seeing task-05, I thought of it as something I could complete later but after a lot of time had already passed I found it difficult to complete. After completing it, I was mentally exhausted and wasn't to focus on any other work for the day. So hey future tryouts if you're reading this which I know some would, treat each and every **main** task equally. The most fun task to do was **Task-02** as putting the co-ordinates in Google Maps was very lively. The most frustraing among all was the **Golang Scrapper (Task-07)** used realising to use **geziyor** after using **colly** for straight 4 days was really exhausting. Now a note for future amFOSS aspirants - if you're reading this do organise your repo from the first day itslef (it really helps on the deadline day)
